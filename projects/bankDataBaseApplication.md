This application was developed by me in my program structure class. I created a mock bank database, which allowed users to be added, deleted, or searched. The database was essential of user objects in a linked list data structure, implemented by myself. Both the UI and backend were implemented in seperate files.

I developed this project by myself in my program structure class with some general advice from my TA.

Through developing this project, I learned about the linked list data structure and how exactly it works, by chaining each user to another. Also, through the implementation of the linked list data structure, I also gained more insight into dynamic memory allocation and pointers. Specifically, how to deal with errors pertaining to them. Also, since C++ is such a low level language, it also allowed me to further grasp exactly how object orientated programming works. Working on the UI also gave me experience on how to create a user friendly UI.
