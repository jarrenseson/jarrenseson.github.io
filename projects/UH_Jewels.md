This web application was developed by Waltz Tuzon, Katelyn Sung, and me in our ICS 314 class. It is a mock jewelry site. It contains 7 'main' pages: the home page, the products page, the shopping cart page, the edit cart page, payment page, and shipping information page. Before the user can even access the products page, they are prompted to login or to register a new account if they have not already. In the product page, our jewelry products, which are read from a database, are listed and can be added to a users cart. From there, users can either click on the cart icon in the top right corner or click the "Proceed to Cart" button underneath all of the products to proceed to their cart. At the cart page, all of a given user's cart items are displayed on a table with the name of the product, quantity, and a link to a form to change the quantity. If a user wishes to change the quantity the form is just a simple one input form that accepts numbers and updates the database according to the given input. After desired changes are made, users would click the "Proceed to Payment" button and input all of their data. After the form is filled out, they can then proceed to the shipping form by clicking the "Continue to Shipping Form" button. Finally, they input their shipping information and click submit to submit their order.
