This project was a website for my church. It displays most of our upcoming events, where we meet, contact information, and pictures of our most recent events. 

I was mainly responsible for keeping the information updated and giving general updates, according to the request of my pastor. I made the "recent events" tab, updated the menu bar, and kept information regarding our upcoming events updated.

Through this project I learned about some basic web design fundamentals, such as how to structure a website to make it visually appealing to the user. Another big thing I learned was how to prioritize certain content, in order to make the site run smoother. I also learned a lot about how to make something that was not only visually appealing to the user but also easy for the user to use.
