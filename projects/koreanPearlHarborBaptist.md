This project involved creating and maintaining a website for my church. It displays our upcoming events, meeting locations, contact information, and pictures from recent events.  

I was primarily responsible for keeping the information updated and making general updates as requested by my pastor. I created the "Recent Events" tab, updated the menu bar, and ensured that information about upcoming events was current.  

Through this project, I learned basic web design fundamentals, such as how to structure a website to make it visually appealing. I also learned how to prioritize certain content to improve the site's performance. For example, under the "Recent Events" tab, I chose the best pictures instead of using the entire album. Additionally, I gained insight into how to create a website that is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly. Overall, this project helped me learn a great deal about UI development, including terminology related to site headers, forms, alignments, and effects applied to them.
