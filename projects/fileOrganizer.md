The goal of this project was to create a Python script that instantly organizes files within a given directory. Using the `os` and `shutil` libraries, I retrieved and managed file paths, and copied and moved files through the file system. This script categorized files based on their extensions and created new folders for previously unseen extensions.  

I developed this script independently, although I gained insights from a few YouTube videos that helped me understand specific methods from both the `os` and `shutil` libraries.  

I learned several things from this project. While working with the `os` library, I became familiar with directory navigation, file metadata, and path management. Additionally, I gained experience with higher-level file operations, such as copying, moving, and deleting files, through the `shutil` library. Altogether, this project deepened my understanding of how Python can be used to create scripts for automating tasks.
