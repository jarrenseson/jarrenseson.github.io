summary: "I developed a Python program that arranges files based on their file extension"
---

The goal of this project was to have a Python script that instantly organized files within a given directory. Through the use of both the os and shutil library, I retrieved and managed file paths, copied, and moved files through the file system. This script categorized files based on their extension and created new folders for previously unseen extensions.

I created this script solely by myself. However, I did gain some insight from a couple of youtube videos that helped me to understand certain methods of both the os and shutil library.

I learned a couple of things from this projects. When using the os library, I familiarized myself with directory navigation, file metadata, and path management. I also learned about higher level file operations, such as copying, moving, and deleting files, through using the shutil library. Altogether, I was able to gain more insight into how Python can be used to create scripts to automate certain tasks.
