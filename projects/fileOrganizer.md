summary: "I developed a Python program that arranges files based on their file extension"

File organizer was a personal project of mine. As a college student, I found myself downloading many files, causing a state of disarray on my desktop. Using Python's os and shutil libraries, I made a program that organizes files by their extension, making a new folder for each new unseen extension.
