*AI has already set itsself in the modern day as a valuable tool. As we continue to advance, it will become a more integral part of our lives*

## AI as a Tool

AI is a relatively new concept and how it should be used in academia has been a hot topic for the last 2 years. I believe that in terms of software engineering, AI should be used to educate developers on topics they don't know. While documentation does exist, it is not as easily usable as a chatbot, such as ChatGPT. Documentation is not always easily digestable. AIs, such as ChatGPT, allow developers to ask questions about specific use cases and the uses of certain code within specfic circumstances. This is something that cannot possibly be covered in documentation. I have personally used ChatGPT to break down code, explain what certain code does, and inform me about how certain aspects work. 

## My Experience with AI
1. Experience WODS
2. In-class Practice WODs
3. In-class WODS
4. Essays
5. Final project
6. Learning a concept / tutorial
7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
8. Asking or answering a smart-question
9. Coding example
10. Explaining code
11. Writing code
12. Documenting code
13. Quality assurance

### Experience WODs
For experience WODs, I used ChatGPT to analyze the code provided in the videos. The prompt I used was "Break down this code line by line". It gave me a simple explaination of what the code did and gave me the peices to eventually understand how each peice interacted with each other.

### In-class Practice WODs
If I was unsure of how to do the in-class practice WODs, I would first ask ChatGPT, "how would I get started with" followed by the WOD instructions. ChatGPT would then return step by step instructions on how to do the desired task. I would then go through each step, asking ChatGPT to clarify at the given step.

### In-class WODs
For in-class WODs, I adopted the same methodology that I used for the in-class practice WODs, since the practice WOD usually didn't cover all of the topics in the real WOD.

### Essays
For essays, I didn't use ChatGPT much however, when I did use it, I only used it to get ideas. For example, for our argumentative essays, I would choose a side to argue for and ask ChatGPT, "give me reasons to support this side of the argument". I then integrated the given reasons into my essay. 

### Final Project
For our final project, I used AI to help assist with UI elements that I had trouble with. When I wanted something to look nicer but wasn't sure how I could, I told ChatGPT to make the given code as nice as possible without affecting functionality. Typically, it would only affect the UI elements, but in some cases it would affect functionality, causing me to rewrite the functional part. 

### Learning a Concept / Tutorial
Using ChatGPT to learn a concept was my biggest portion of AI use. Whenever I didn't understand something, I would tell ChatGPT, "pretend you are a senior software engineer, explain this topic". If there was something within that explaination that didn't suffice I asked ChatGPT to further explain on that part. This was particulary useful when learning about more advanced SQL queries. 

### Answering a Question in Class or Discord
For this course element, I didn't use AI. I didn't use AI for this element because typically the question asked requires a lot of context for ChatGPT to answer correctly, some of which would be hard to explain and other which I might not have even known of. Also, the questions asked usually already had an answer within the Discord or Stack Overflow, as such it wouldn't really make sense to resort to AI.

### Asking or Answering a Smart Question
For asking or answering a smart question I adopted the same mentality as I did for answering a question in class or Discord, first searching the class Discord and then Stack Overflow.

### Coding Example
For coding examples, I told ChatGPT, "give an example of" followed by the function/code I needed an example of. This was particulary helpful with React forms and prop validation.

### Explaining Code
For explaining code, I told ChatGPT "explain this code line by line" followed by the code I needed help with. This helped me to understand what each peice of the code meant and the overall goal of the code.

### Writing Code
For writing code, I mainly used ChatGPT to help me generate UI elements. I would use the prompt "generate a react component" followed by certain requirements that I wanted it to fufill. 

### Documenting Code
For documenting code, I would first copy and paste the code into ChatGPT, followed by "create documentation for this code". It would typically give an overall description of the code, syntax, parameters, and a usage example.

### Quality Assurance
After I would finish writing code, I would copy and paste the code into ChatGPT, followed by "make sure everything is implemented to the highest quality". This would ensure that everything is up to standard. Sometimes however, the code generate by ChatGPT would break some ESLint rules, and I would therefore have to make a work around for that.
