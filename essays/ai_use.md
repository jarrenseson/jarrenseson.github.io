## AI as a Tool  

AI is a relatively new concept, and its use in academia has been a hot topic for the past two years. In terms of software engineering, I believe AI should be used to educate developers on topics they are unfamiliar with. While documentation exists, it is not as user-friendly as a chatbot like ChatGPT. Documentation is not always easily digestible. AIs, such as ChatGPT, allow developers to ask specific questions about use cases and the application of certain code in particular circumstances—something that cannot always be fully covered in documentation.  

I have personally used ChatGPT to break down code, explain its functionality, and educate myself on how certain aspects work.  

## My Experience with AI  

1. Experience WODs  
2. In-class Practice WODs  
3. In-class WODs  
4. Essays  
5. Final Project  
6. Learning a Concept/Tutorial  
7. Answering a Question in Class or Discord  
8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question  
9. Coding Examples  
10. Explaining Code  
11. Writing Code  
12. Documenting Code  
13. Quality Assurance  

### Experience WODs  

For experience WODs, I used ChatGPT to analyze the code provided in the videos. My prompt was: "Break down this code line by line." ChatGPT gave me a simple explanation of what the code did and helped me understand how the pieces interacted with each other.  

### In-class Practice WODs  

If I was unsure how to complete the in-class practice WODs, I would first ask ChatGPT, "How would I get started with [WOD instructions]?" ChatGPT returned step-by-step instructions, which I followed while asking for clarification at each step.  

### In-class WODs  

For in-class WODs, I adopted the same methodology as for the practice WODs, since the practice WODs usually didn’t cover all the topics in the actual WOD.  

### Essays  

For essays, I didn’t use ChatGPT extensively. However, when I did, it was primarily to generate ideas. For instance, in our argumentative essays, I chose a side and asked ChatGPT, "Give me reasons to support this side of the argument." I then incorporated these reasons into my essay.  

### Final Project  

For our final project, I used AI to assist with UI elements I found challenging. When I wanted to improve the aesthetics of a design, I asked ChatGPT to optimize the given code for visual appeal without compromising functionality. Occasionally, it affected the functional aspects, requiring me to rewrite the functional portions.  

### Learning a Concept/Tutorial  

Using ChatGPT to learn concepts accounted for most of my AI usage. Whenever I didn’t understand something, I asked ChatGPT to "Pretend you are a senior software engineer. Explain this topic." If I needed more detail, I followed up with specific questions. This approach was particularly useful when learning advanced SQL queries.  

### Answering Questions in Class or Discord  

For this course element, I didn’t rely on AI. Class and Discord questions typically required a lot of context, some of which was hard to explain or unknown to me. Moreover, most answers could be found in Discord or Stack Overflow.  

### Asking or Answering a Smart Question  

For asking or answering smart questions, I first searched the class Discord or Stack Overflow before turning to AI, using the same rationale as above.  

### Coding Examples  

For coding examples, I prompted ChatGPT with "Give an example of [function/code]." This was especially helpful for React forms and prop validation.  

### Explaining Code  

To understand specific code, I prompted ChatGPT: "Explain this code line by line." This clarified the purpose of each code segment and its overall goal.  

### Writing Code  

For writing code, I primarily used ChatGPT to generate UI components. My typical prompt was: "Generate a React component" followed by specific requirements.  

### Documenting Code  

For documentation, I copied and pasted the code into ChatGPT, asking it to "Create documentation for this code." The output included an overview, syntax, parameters, and usage examples.  

### Quality Assurance  

After writing code, I used ChatGPT to ensure quality by asking it to "Make sure everything is implemented to the highest standard." While helpful, its suggestions sometimes broke ESLint rules, requiring workarounds.  

## What I Learned  

Experimenting with AI this semester revealed its undeniable value in software engineering. However, it has limitations. For ChatGPT to be truly effective, queries must be highly specific. A major strength of ChatGPT lies in generating basic code, which has profound implications for the future of software engineering. Overall, AI has enhanced my learning, helping me better understand React, SQL, TypeScript, design patterns, and troubleshooting methods.  

## AI in the Real World  

AI has practical applications in hackathons, healthcare, and climate solutions. In hackathons, participants are encouraged to use AI for tasks such as data analysis, predictive modeling, and natural language processing, freeing time for other activities and boosting productivity.  

## Challenges and Opportunities With AI  

Despite its power, AI has shortcomings. Its effectiveness depends on precise queries, and its outputs may not align with academic principles. Insufficient interaction with AI tools can also hinder students' ability to connect concepts.  

Opportunities include tools like GitHub Copilot making code writing easier and enabling automated feedback and grading.  

## Traditional Teaching vs. AI-Enhanced Approaches  

AI-enhanced approaches offer interactive, personalized learning compared to traditional passive methods. For example:  

- **Engagement**: AI tools like virtual labs foster interactivity.  
- **Retention**: AI provides immediate feedback, improving knowledge retention.  
- **Skill Development**: AI simulates realistic problem scenarios with automated performance feedback.  

## AI in the Future of Software Engineering Education  

The future of AI in education will likely include adaptive learning, intelligent feedback, and enhanced scalability. However, challenges such as ethical concerns, reliance on AI tools, and the role of human instructors remain.  

## AI Reflections and Insights  

Integrating AI into education improves learning personalization, skill development, engagement, and workload management. Balancing AI usage with foundational skills, fostering realistic project-based learning, and training faculty are essential for effective AI adoption.
