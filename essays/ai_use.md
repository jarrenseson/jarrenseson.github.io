## AI as a Tool

AI is a relatively new concept and how it should be used in academia has been a hot topic for the last 2 years. I believe that in terms of software engineering, AI should be used to educate developers on topics they don't know. While documentation does exist, it is not as easily usable as a chatbot, such as ChatGPT. Documentation is not always easily digestable. AIs, such as ChatGPT, allow developers to ask questions about specific use cases and the uses of certain code within specfic circumstances. This is something that cannot possibly be covered in documentation. I have personally used ChatGPT to break down code, explain what certain code does, and inform me about how certain aspects work.

### Experience WODS
For experience WODS, I used ChatGPT to analyze the code provided in the videos. The prompt I used was "Break down this code line by line". It gave me a simple explaination of what the code did and gave me the peices to eventually understand how each peice interacted with each other.
