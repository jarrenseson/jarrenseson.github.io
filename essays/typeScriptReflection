*Many people say that JavaScript and by extension TypeScript is a rather tricky language to deal with. I would agree with that.*

## Union Type

One thing in particular that I like about TypeScript is its addition of the union type. I think that the union type has many instances where it can be applied. I have definitely had instances with other programming languages, where the union type would have been useful.

## Static Typing

Another thing I like TypeScript over JavaScript is static typing. Many times in JavaScript I found an error that took me a long time to fix simply because I didn’t use an “= 0”. Also, being able to see what the type is in the code makes the readability of the code significantly better and more predictable. 

## Interfaces 

Lastly, I also like TypeScripts inclusion of interfaces. It really helps being able to have an outline of an object saved, just like other programming languages.
