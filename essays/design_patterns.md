*In a technical interview, the question "what are design patterns?" and "what design patterns have you used in your own code" may be asked. As aspiring computer science graduates, we should be able to answer this question.*

## The Key and the Lock

Throughout the process of software design, software developers will inevitably run into many issues. We can think of these issues as a lock, blocking us from the desired sofware. Since many of these "locks" commonly occur, software developers can mold a key for these common problems. This "key" is what a design pattern is. The "key" represents the best practices to follow in order to unlock these "locks". The main thing that design patterns aim to do is to guide developers to develop software that is efficient, maintanable, and scaleable. Some examples of design patterns include: Singleton, MVC, Observer, Factory, Publish-Subscribe, Prototype, and Front Controller.
