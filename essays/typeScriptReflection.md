*Many people say that JavaScript and by extension TypeScript is a rather tricky language to deal with. I would agree with that. Due to the addition of different types and other features, which are not included in other languages, I think that it has a steeper learning curve than some of the other languages I have learned.*

## Union Type

One thing in particular that I like about TypeScript is its addition of the union type. I think that the union type has many instances where it can be applied, as it allows for more flexibility. I have definitely had instances with other programming languages, where the union type would have been useful. I think that the union type should be become a type that is more universal among other programming languages. It also allows for better handling of optional values, such as return types of functions.

## Static Typing

Another thing I like TypeScript over JavaScript is static typing. Many times in JavaScript I found an error that took me a long time to fix simply because I didn’t use an “= 0”. Also, being able to see what the type is in the code makes the readability of the code significantly better and more predictable. Because of this, static typing also makes collaboration with teammates significantly easier and also makes scaling projects easier. Another benefit is being able to catch errors at compile time, preventing bugs, such as attempting to access undefined variables or a mismatched type error.

## Interfaces

Lastly, I also like TypeScripts inclusion of interfaces. It really helps being able to have an outline of an object saved, just like other programming languages. Because it forces objects to have a defined structure, it also makes errors get caught at compile time as opposed to run time. Because it defines an objects structure, it also allows for easier code reusability. Also, it allows for extensibility, allowing for more complex structures. 

## TypeScript for Software Engineering?

As a whole, I think that TypeScript is a good language for web development, as it adds many useful features, that attempt to compensate for JavaScript's shortcomings. For example, static typing and type annotations, allowing for greater scalability. Also, because of its active community, there is much documentation and third party tools. However, I think that web application development is the only application for it. For other types of applications there are more more suitable languages for the tasks at hand.
