*Many people say that JavaScript and by extension TypeScript is a rather tricky language to deal with. I would agree with that. Due to the addition of different types and other features, which are not included in other languages, I think that it has a steeper learning curve than some of the other languages I have learned.*

## Union Type

One thing in particular that I like about TypeScript is its addition of the union type. I think that the union type has many instances where it can be applied. I have definitely had instances with other programming languages, where the union type would have been useful.

## Static Typing

Another thing I like TypeScript over JavaScript is static typing. Many times in JavaScript I found an error that took me a long time to fix simply because I didn’t use an “= 0”. Also, being able to see what the type is in the code makes the readability of the code significantly better and more predictable.

## Interfaces

Lastly, I also like TypeScripts inclusion of interfaces. It really helps being able to have an outline of an object saved, just like other programming languages. 

## TypeScript for Software Engineering?

As a whole, I think that TypeScript is a good language for web development, as it adds many useful features, that attempt to compensate for JavaScript's shortcomings. However, I think that web development is the only application for it. For other types of applications there are more suitable languages for the tasks at hand
