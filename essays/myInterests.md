*Software engineering is a very diverse field, which covers a wide array of topics, such as DevOps engineering, front end development, back end development, full stack development, and much more.*

## Automation

Due to the rise of newer high level languages, such as Python, learning to program has never been easier. Due to Python's easy readability and extensive library, it has become the go to language for scripting and automation. Many times I find myself doing tedious and mundane tasks on my computer, which could easily be done much quicker and more accurately by a computer. As such, I have been trying to learn and create more Python projects. Not only can scripting assist me in day to day life, but it could also simplify the lives of many and help others with what we would consider to be "busy" work.

## AI/Machine Learning



## Game Development
