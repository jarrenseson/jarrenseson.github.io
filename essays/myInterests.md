*Software engineering is a diverse field covering a wide array of topics, including DevOps engineering, front-end development, back-end development, full-stack development, and much more.*

## Automation  

With the rise of newer high-level languages like Python, learning to program has never been easier. Thanks to Python's easy readability and extensive libraries, it has become the go-to language for scripting and automation.  

Often, I find myself doing tedious and mundane tasks on my computer—tasks that could be done much quicker and more accurately by a computer. As a result, I’ve been learning and creating more Python projects. Not only can scripting assist me in day-to-day life, but it can also simplify the lives of others by handling what we often consider "busy" work.  

## AI/Machine Learning  

In recent years, we’ve witnessed rapid advancements in AI and machine learning. Many basic aspects of our lives are now influenced by AI, often without us even realizing it.  

For example, if you own an iPhone X or newer, every time you unlock your phone using Face ID, the device accesses data models based on millions of other facial images captured under various lighting conditions, angles, and scenarios.  

It’s only a matter of time before AI becomes even more integrated into our daily lives. Fully autonomous vehicles are another example of AI's growing presence. While these cars are not yet perfect, they signify the dawn of a new technological era, which we may fully realize in the coming decades.  

## Cybersecurity  

Unfortunately, technological advancements benefit not only those with good intentions but also those with malicious ones. Now, more than ever, sophisticated cybersecurity systems are essential.  

As we rely more on technology, its security becomes increasingly critical. For instance, entire branches of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), such as the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), are dedicated to securing global telecommunications, IT infrastructure, and other services that support the U.S. military and government.  

Interestingly, this branch of the DoD is still relatively young, having been founded in 1991. Its continued growth underscores the importance of cybersecurity in an increasingly digital world.
