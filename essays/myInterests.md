*Software engineering is a very diverse field, which covers a wide array of topics, such as DevOps engineering, front end development, back end development, full stack development, and much more.*

## Automation

Due to the rise of newer high level languages, such as Python, learning to program has never been easier. Due to Python's easy readability and extensive library, it has become the go to language for scripting and automation. Many times I find myself doing tedious and mundane tasks on my computer, which could easily be done much quicker and more accurately by a computer. As such, I have been trying to learn and create more Python projects. Not only can scripting assist me in day to day life, but it could also simplify the lives of many and help others with what we would consider to be "busy" work.

## AI/Machine Learning

Over the past couple of years we have seen rapid devlopment in the AI/machine learning sector of technology. It is to the point where many basic aspects of our life are influenced by AI without us even realizing it. For example, if you have an Iphone X or anything older, anytime you open your phone using face ID your phone accesses data models, based on millions of other facial images with other lightings, angles, etc. It is only a matter of time till AI will have the capabilities to have an even more prevelant presence in our lives. Another example, which is more prevelant in our lives are fully autonomous vehicles. We are now capable of having fully autonomous cars. Although imperfect, it is a harbinger of a new era of technology, which we may see in the coming century.

## Cyber Security 

Sadly, the technological advances that have occurred are not only expended to those with good intentions but also those with malicious intent. As such, now more than ever we need more sophisticated cyber security systems. As we become more technologically advanced, we rely more on it, which is why it is so important. For example, entire branches of the DOD, such as the Defense Information System Agency (DISA), are responsible for securing global telecommunications, IT infrastructure, and other services, which support the US military and government. This branch of the DOD is still relatively new, only being founded in 1991.
