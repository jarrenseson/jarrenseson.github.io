*Throughout the course of ICS 314, I learned many new concepts, such as open source software development, configuration management, development environments, etc. However, the concepts that resonated with me the most were coding standards, functional programming, and agile project management*

## Coding Standards, a Universal Language
One key takeaway from this class is the importance of coding standards. Coding standards are a set of criteria and practices, that are designed to encourage higher quality, readability, and maintainability of code. Some of these practices include formatting rules, documentation, code structure, and testing. Before this class, I had not had many classes where coding standards were heavily focused. For example, in my ICS 311 course, the majority of the assignments were group work, and coding standards were nonexistent. Comparing the course's project's code, the projects with coding standards implemented are a lot easier to read and therefore made collaboration significantly easier. As such, I will continue to use coding standards in all of my future projects, even solo projects. This is because while coding standards make collaboration easier, collaboration is not the sole purpose of coding standards.

## Functional Programming
Functional programming is a programming paradigm, that allows for variables to be set as functions. As a result of this state changes and mutable data is avoided. In this course I learned that functional programming can simplify code and make it less tedious to write. Some functions I learned about were map, filter, and reduce. If I wanted to achieve the same effect of these functions, I would need to write many for loops, decreasing efficiency and overall wasting more time. Functional programming already extends far past just web application development. Some examples include immutable data structures, data analysis workflows, and pure functions, ensuring that data is consistent and reproducible. Functional programming is something that I will implement in future coding projects, as it is much simpler than having to write out numerous for loops. 

## Agile Project Management
Agile project management is a project management style that encourages flexibility and collaboration. It does this by breaking down work into smaller pieces. This allows teams better adapt to requirements of the software. The type of agile project management we used in this class was issue driven project management(IDPM). The IDPM process first describes issues that need to be fixed and assigns the issue to a person with each issue having a varying level of priority. By using IDPM, we can hold developers accountable for what they are supposed to do while also having more clarity on issues. IDPM can definitely be applied outside of web application development. One example could be a machine learning project. Issues could be categorized in data preprocessing, model selection, or hyperparameter tuning.
